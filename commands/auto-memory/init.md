---

Initialize auto-managed CLAUDE.md files for this project.

Invoke the `codebase-analyzer` skill to:
1. Analyze the codebase structure
2. Detect frameworks and build commands
3. Identify subtree candidates for monorepos
4. Detect code patterns and conventions

Guide the user through the setup process and confirm before writing any files.
